REVERSI PROJECT
Reversi is a two player game with black or while pieces (denoted by 'W' & 'B') in the ouput window. The specifics of the rules can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules. 
The solution that I had created works for single player (basic computer opponent) and doble player.
