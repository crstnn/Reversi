## REVERSI PROJECT (for reversi.py)<br />
Reversi is a two player game with black or while pieces (denoted by 'W' & 'B') in the ouput window. The rules can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules. 
The solution that I created works for a single player (with a basic computer opponent) or two players.
Pick one of the last two lines of the reversi.py file if you want to change it from its default two player mode
